      <SectionTitle>§3 · Final Verdict</SectionTitle>
      <Prose>
        <p>
          Our staff has final verdict. <strong>If you are told to stop</strong>{" "}
          doing something by our staff, <strong>you stop</strong> — and we
          reserve the right to take action if you do not.
        </p>
        <Note variant="warning" className="my-4">
          Any action taken by our staff is final and is not up for debate.
          Complaining openly or repeatedly will get you nowhere.
        </Note>
        <p>
          If you believe staff have taken an action that was unjustified, you
          may make a complaint to the server owner.
        </p>

        <h3>What to Include in a Complaint</h3>
        <p>When submitting a complaint, provide the following details.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the staff member involved</li>
          <li>
            The action that staff member took that you felt was unjustified
          </li>
          <li>Why you found the action unjustified</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once you have done so, the server owner will investigate your
          complaint and get back to you. Their response is final — you may ask
          questions about it, but <strong>arguing will get you nowhere</strong>.
        </p>
        <Note className="my-4">
          Most of our internal affairs happen out of your sight. This does not
          mean nothing is happening — please be patient.
